You are an expert document formatter and OCR extractor.

I will provide you with two images:

1. Image A → A blank biodata template (design layout only)
2. Image B → A filled biodata template with actual data

Your task is:

STEP 1: Carefully read Image B and extract ONLY the textual data values.
- Do NOT copy colors, borders, decorations, fonts, or styling.
- Only extract the actual field values (like name, date of birth, caste, education, etc.)

STEP 2: Identify the matching labels/fields in Image A (the blank template).

STEP 3: Insert the extracted data from Image B into the correct corresponding positions in Image A.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Keep the design, borders, ornaments, spacing, and layout EXACTLY same as Image A.
- Replace only the empty placeholders in Image A with the data from Image B.
- Keep alignment and structure clean and readable.
- Use the same language (Marathi/English mix) as in Image B.
- Do not invent or change any values.
- If any field is missing in Image B, leave it blank in Image A.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return the final result as a clean formatted text layout that mirrors Image A structure with filled data.

Do NOT include explanations.
Return only the final filled template content.
