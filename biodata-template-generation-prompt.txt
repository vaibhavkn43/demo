Refine the previously generated traditional Marathi wedding biodata background.

Canvas size: A4 portrait, 1080x1528 px, 300 DPI.

Keep:
- Same off-white handmade paper texture
- Same thin traditional Maharashtrian floral border
- Same subtle mandala corner patterns
- Same elegant maroon, beige, gold color palette

Mandatory corrections:
- REMOVE any religious symbol (no Om, no swastik, no icons)
- Keep the top decorative arch ONLY as an empty frame
- The top center area must be completely blank inside the arch
- Slightly increase vertical space inside the arch for placing a god sticker later
- Slightly thicken the arch outline for clarity

Layout adjustments:
- Increase inner border margin slightly for print safety
- Keep entire content area clean and empty

Rules:
- NO text
- NO symbols
- NO photos
- Background design only
- Print-ready, elegant, traditional

This design will be used as a dynamic biodata template where god image and mantra text are added later programmatically.
